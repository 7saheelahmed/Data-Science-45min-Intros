    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to introduce a few basical vocabularies, ideas, and Python libraries for thinking about topic modeling, in order to make sure that we have a good set of vocabulary to talk more in-depth about processing languge with Python later. We'll spend some time on defining vocabulary for topic modeling and using basic topic modeling tools.\n",

    "### Definitions.\n",
    "1. **Document**: a body of text (eg. tweet)\n",
    "2. **Tokenization**: dividing a document into pieces (and maybe throwing away some characters), in English this often (but not necessarily) means words separated by spaces and puctuation.\n",
    "3. **Text corpus**: the set of documents that contains the text for the analysis (eg. many tweets)\n",
    "4. **Stop words**: words that occur so frequently, or have so little topical meaning, that they are excluded (e.g., \"and\")\n",
    "5. **Vectorize**: Turn some documents into vectors\n",
    "6. **Vector corpus**: the set of documents transformed such that each token is a tuple (token_id , doc_freq)"

    "### 2) Tokenization\n",
    "We split each document into smaller pieces (\"tokens\") in a process called tokenization. Tokens can be counted, and most importantly, compared between documents. There are potentially many different ways to tokenize text--splitting on spaces, removing punctionation, diving the document into n-character pieces--anything that gives us tokens that we can, hopefully, effectively compare across documents and derive meaning from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to tokenization are processes called *stemming* and *lemmatiztion* which can help when using tokens to model topics based on the meaning of a word. In the phrases \"they run\" and \"he runs\" (space separated tokens: [\"they\", \"run\"] and [\"he\", \"runs\"]) the words \"run\" and \"run*s*\" mean basically the same thing, but are two different tokens. Stemming and/or lemmatization help us compare tokens with the same meaning but different spelling/suffixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lemmatization:\n",
    "Uses a dictionary of words and their possible morphologies to map many different forms of a base word (\"lemma\") to a single lemma, comparable across documents. E.g.: \"run\", \"ran\", \"runs\", and \"running\" might all map to the lemma \"run\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stemming: \n",
    "Uses a set of heuristic rules to try to approximate lemmatization, without knowing the words in advance. For the English language, a simple and effective stemming algorithm might simply be to remove an \"s\" from the ends of words, or an \"ing\" from the end of words. E.g.: \"run\", \"runs\", and \"running\" all map to \"run,\" but \"ran\" (an irregularrly conjugated verb) would not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is particularly interesting and applicable in social data, because while some words are decidely *not* standard English, conventinoal rules of grammar still apply. A fan of the popular singer Justin Bieber might call herself a \"belieber,\" while a group of fans call themselves \"beliebers.\" You won't find \"belieber\" in any English lemmatization dictionary, but a good stemming algorithm will still map \"belieber\" and \"beliebers\" to the same token (\"belieber\", or even \"belieb\", if we remover the common suffix \"er\")."
