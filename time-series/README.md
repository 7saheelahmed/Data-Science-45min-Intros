# Time Series Data In Pandas

*Josh Montague*

This session was generally built using Python 3.5, ``matplotlib>=2.0``, and ``pandas>=0.19``.

In Part 1 of the "Time Series Modeling in Python" series, we look at how ``pandas`` deals with time series data, and some of the handy functionality that the data structures have, built-in.

In Part 2, we implement a handful of simple time series models, apply them to some univariate time series data, and look at a couple of evaluation metrics for regression models.
