### Understanding the K-means algorithm

In this tutorial, we build up the k-means algorithm step-by-step. This tutorial uses only standard python.

The steps are designed to logically build up the pieces from the perspective of asking and answering simple questions about a data distribution.

To use this notebook, you'll need an installation of Python (preferably a recent version of Python 3), Jupyter (to run the notebook, `pip install jupyter`) and matplotlib (for the plotting, `pip install matplotlib`). 
To solve any real problems, use scikit-learn.

Enjoy!
