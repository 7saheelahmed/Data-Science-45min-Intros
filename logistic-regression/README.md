#Builder up Logistic Regression from the basics


2013, Scott Hendrickson

A short introduction to Logistic Regression. We build up the basic pieces with simple arguments and end up with a basic classifier that is simple to understand and very fast to run on some toy problems. In the end, you want to use Scikit Learn.

This session was built using: 

- Python 2.7 
- IPython 1.x
- numpy 1.7
- matplotlib 1.2
- pandas 0.9.1
