    "## Why PGMs?\n",
    "When we started statistics, we talked about measurements, for example, of the height of students in you school, and noted that instances of these meansurements--events--fall into a probabiliy distribution. In this case, it was likely a Normal-looking distribution with many measurements around the average and a few measurements larger or smaller than average.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduced the idea of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we when measurements of a random variable fall according to some complex probability distribution? This happens all the time. Sometimes we approximate. Other times, we realize that the random variable we are measuring has some comlex underlying dependencies, possibly on other distributions, and we can address these with a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine that we measure the heights of 7th graders in your school and call this our random variable. Later, we realize that the average height of males and females is different by a few inches. We need a model that accounts for the depencence of height on sex at this age.\n",
