### Horizon Graph
Originally called "two-tone pseudo-coloring", a horizon graph increases the density of time series graphs by dividing and layering filled line charts.  

Intro:  
* We review [Sizing the Horizon: The Effects of Chart Size and Layering on the Grahpical Perception of Time Series Visualizations](http://www.vis.berkeley.edu/papers/horizon/2009-TimeSeries-CHI.pdf).  

* We will use [this example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1483226) to illustrate these definitions:  
    1. Mirror  
    2. Offset  
    3. Band
    
Outline:  
* Problem: creating an effective presentation of multiple time series.
* Goal: display more charts in a fixed area.
* Reason: viewers need to quickly and reliably spot trends.
